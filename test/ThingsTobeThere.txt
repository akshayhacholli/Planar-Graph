For the graphs I have generated this semester, the following are some of 
the parameters I have used:
1. |V|
2. |E| (approximate size; when edges are created at random, sometimes 
same (u,v) will be generated more than once.  I compact the graph at 
output, but not during generation).
3. Directed?
4. DAG?
5. Maximum and minimum edge weights
6. Number of negative edges and their range
7. Grid graphs (layered graphs)
8. Probability distribution that is nonuniform
9. Graphs with hidden hamiltonian cycles
10. Graphs with vertex cover of given size 


11. MST of Fixed Range
